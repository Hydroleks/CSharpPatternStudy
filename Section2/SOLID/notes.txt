S - Single responsibility - whole point is that the 1 class has only 1 thing to do and 1 thing to change.
O - Open-Close principle - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. How; use of Interfaces and Inheritance. Use of pattern(not a GoF pattern; enterprise patter: Specification pattern.)

D - Dependancy Inversion -
